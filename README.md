# A Precision Medicine Framework for Cerebrovascular Disease: Lessons learned from a study of diagnostic accuracy

This repository contains the code and relevant resources for the research study "A precision medicine framework for cerebrovascular disease: Lessons learned from a study of diagnostic accuracy." Our goal was to design and validate a predictive model aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, using a precision medicine approach.

## Project Overview

This research study aims to increase diagnostic accuracy for cerebrovascular diseases, leading to improved patient outcomes. Utilizing machine learning and a wealth of data sources, we have developed a framework for precision medicine. The framework enables the integration of diverse data, including genetic information, clinical phenotypes, and various biomarkers, which increases the precision of diagnosis and subsequently, the effectiveness of treatment strategies.
