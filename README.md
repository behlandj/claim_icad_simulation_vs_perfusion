# A Precision Medicine Framework for Cerebrovascular Disease: Lessons Learned from a Study of Diagnostic Accuracy

This repository contains the code for a study entitled "A Precision Medicine Framework for Cerebrovascular Disease: Lessons Learned from a Study of Diagnostic Accuracy". 

A link to the manuscript of our study will be provided after publication. 

## Project Outline

The main focus of this study is the quantitative validation of a simulation-based precision medicine framework developed by our group, specifically designed for the evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics in patients suffering from Intracranial Arterial Disease (ICAD). The validation is based on comparison with Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DSC-MRI).

The simulation framework manuscript can be accessed here: (https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12938-021-00880-w)

## Repository Contents

The repository comprises two files that are instrumental in the analysis and interpretation of the study data:

1. `nipype_pypeline.py`: This file contains a post-processing pipeline that aids in the evaluation of the relative Mean Transit Time (relMTT) using DSC-MRI. The pipeline is designed using Nipype, an open-source project that provides a uniform interface to existing neuroimaging software.

2. `statistics.py`: This file includes the analysis of diagnostic accuracy which involves the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis incl. ROC curve figures.

## Data accessability

The data used in this study is not openly available due to data privacy regulations. Access can be granted for qualified scientific requests.
